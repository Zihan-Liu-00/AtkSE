# AtkSE
Pytorch implementation for the gray-box structural attacker AtkSE from CIKM22 paper 'Are Gradients on Graph Structure Reliable in Gray-box Attacks?'

We strongly recommand NeurIPS 2022 paper 'Towards Reasonable Budget Allocation in Untargeted Graph Structure Attacks via Gradient Debias' to audiences who are interested in this paper/area. It performs better than this paper in both attack performance and computational efficiency. The innovation points of these two papers are not overlapped, so audience can try to combine the methods covered in these two papers if a better attack performance is demanded.
